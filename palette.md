# Primary Palette
Kiva color palette has been created to reflect the spirit of the brand. Red and Green is used across all our communication as an essential element of branding. Black is used primarily for body text and headings, and White is used for screen backgrounds and negative space.

# Secondary Palette
Secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish our product. Each color is selected with purpose in order to provide meaningful feedback within our products. Usage of these colors varies depending on the touch point, but they come in handy for illustrations and components 

# Shades and Tints Extended Palette
We intend for tints and shades to be ever evolving, offering an endless palette to choose from. Usage of these colors varies depending on the touch point, but they come in handy for illustrations and components  

## Kiva Mint

# Color Role
Colors in Kiva are used sparingly to draw attention to important elements and those that we want the user to take action on, this maintains visual hierarchy. Also certain colors have inherent meaning for a large majority of users. For example, we use shade of red to communicate an error, this helps to communicate visually.

Following is a set of specific guidelines for when and how to use each color in our palette.

# Color Contrast
We ensure that all types of color combinations on our platform must pass WCAG AA standards. WCAG recommends contrast ratio of atleast 4.5:1 for small text(14px) against its background and at least 3:1 for large text(16+px). The contrast ratio between a color and its background is based on its luminance. Color contrasts can be checked here- https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
