# Language tone and voice

Kiva’s voice is hopeful, conversational and warm. We focus on opportunity and possibility, not tragedy, in our storytelling and communication.

We highlight what connects all of us as a global community and the human experiences that we all share.

# Guidelines for writing for Kiva

* Use clear, simple language
* Express appreciation and emotion where appropriate
* Always remain respectful, to all people and cultures
* Tell human stories, give a window into someone else’s life and experience
* Capture the big picture, share how the loan fits into the borrower’s long-term dreams and aspirations
* Look for the ripples of impact, often a loan can create positive change for the whole family or community
* Aim to inspire and connect


# Guidelines for writing for Kiva
* Keep paragraphs short, 2 to 3 sentences maximum
* Refer to borrowers and lenders by first name whenever possible
* Reinforce that lending is unique and different from donations (e.g., lenders don’t ‘give’ or ‘donate’ to a loan, they support or back a loan)
* Use sentence case capitalization for headlines, subheads and labels
* Use contractions freely
* Salutations should be informal (e.g. hi, best wishes)
* Resist using overly-academic terms or microfinance jargon
* Use Kiva, not Kiva.org
* All numbers from 1 to 999,999 should be written as numerals
* For larger numbers, use a numeral and spell out million or billion (e.g., 5 million)
