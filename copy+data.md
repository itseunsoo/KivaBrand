# How it works

* Kiva runs on donations. The loans go to the borrowers.
* Loans are crowdfunded on Kiva.org by a global community of over 1.6 million people.
* Kiva’s U.S. borrowers have a 100% success rate of fully funding their loans.
* Kiva reaches borrowers across the world through field partners who facilitate loan disbursement and repayment.
* Kiva has provided loans to over 3.6 million borrowers.
* 84% of Kiva borrowers are women.
