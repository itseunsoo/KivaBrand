<p>Our logo is based on simple shapes. It is carefully constructed to maintain ownable characteristics while allowing for perfect legibility at any size on any application. The dynamic space between the U and the B is made possible by our kickstand U that has a vertical stroke descending from the right side.</p>

<p>In certain situations, the logo can also be used on a white or contextually colored background, as long as there is a 3:1 contrast ratio. Anything less may compromise visibility and is not recommended. Color contrasts can be checked here- https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</p>
