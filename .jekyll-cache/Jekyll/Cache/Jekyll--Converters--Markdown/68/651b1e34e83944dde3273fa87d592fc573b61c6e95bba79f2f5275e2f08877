<p>Kivaâ€™s photography plays a large role in creating a narrative and an emotional connection to the users. Image usage should always honor the featured individuals, keeping them in focus and highlighting their diverse environments. Kiva images are also not of plight or catastrophe, we aim to highlight the hope and opportunity of Kiva, even if borrowers are in difficult situations. General retouching notes: Images should stay bright, natural and
vibrant. They should not look over processed or stylized. Maintain the natural light whenever possible. The individuals in the image should be prioritized. DO not alter skin/hair tones or texture. Brightening up images in with heavy shadows/poor lighting is ok but with careful attention to maintaining original skin colour. Removing/ minimizing noisy backgrounds is ok within reason.</p>
