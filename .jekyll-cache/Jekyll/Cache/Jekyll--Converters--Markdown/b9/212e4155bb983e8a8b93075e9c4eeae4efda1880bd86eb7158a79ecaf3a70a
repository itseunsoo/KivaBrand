<p>Colors in Kiva are used sparingly to draw attention to important elements and those that we want the user to take action on, this maintains visual hierarchy. Also certain colors have inherent meaning for a large majority of users. For example, we use shade of red to communicate an error, this helps to communicate visually.</p>

<p>Following is a set of specific guidelines for when and how to use each color in our palette.</p>

<h1 id="color-contrast">Color Contrast</h1>
<p>We ensure that all types of color combinations on our platform must pass WCAG AA standards. WCAG recommends contrast ratio of atleast 4.5:1 for small text(14px) against its background and at least 3:1 for large text(16+px). The contrast ratio between a color and its background is based on its luminance. Color contrasts can be checked here- https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</p>
